# Interactive Rating Component

This is a solution to the Interactive Rating Component challenge on Frontend Mentor. It's built with React.js and CSS.

## Challenge Description

The challenge was to build an interactive rating component where users can hover over the stars to see the rating value, and click on a star to set the rating. The design included a different color for each rating level and a reset button.

## Solution Overview

I used React.js to build the component, with CSS for styling. The component consists of a parent container with five child star elements that change color on hover and on click. I added state to keep track of the current rating and used props to pass the rating color to the stars. The reset button sets the rating back to zero.

## Usage

To run the app, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then run:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, run:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your browser.
